.SH Name
Xv \- X Window System video extension
.SH Description
The Xv extension provides support for video adaptors attached to an X
display.  It takes the approach that a display may have one or more
video adaptors, each of which has one or more ports through which
independent video streams pass.  
.PP
An adaptor may be able to display video in a drawable, capture video
from a drawable, or both.  It translates between video encoding (NTSC,
PAL, SECAM, etc...) and drawable format (depth and visual-id pair). An
adaptor may support multiple video encodings and/or multiple drawable
formats.
.PP
Clients use Xv(3) to gain access and manage sharing of a display's
video resources.  Typically, a client will use XvQueryExtension(3) to
determine the status of the extension, XvQueryAdaptors(3) to get a
description of what video adaptors exist, and XvQueryEncodings(3) to
get a description of what video encodings an adaptor supports.
.PP
Once a client has determined what video resources are available, it is
free to put video into a drawable or get video from a drawable,
according the capabilities supported.  Clients can select to receive
events when video activity changes in a drawable and when port
attributes have changed.
